## Debugging

<p></p>

The `bazel-stack-vscode-go` intends to make bazel/rules_go workspaces work
better with vscode and the vscode-go extension.  This *should* include debugger
support.

In the meantime, see the mini-tutorial about using [delve](/debugging/delve) from the
command-line with bazel/golang binaries.
