## Debugging

<p></p>

The `bazel-stack-vscode-go` intends to make bazel/rules_go workspaces work
better with vscode and the vscode-go extension.  This *should* include debugger
support (but does not currently).

In the meantime, see the mini-tutorial about using
[delve](/bazel-stack-vscode-go/debugging/delve) from the command-line with
bazel/golang binaries.
